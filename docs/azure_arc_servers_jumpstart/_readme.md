# Azure Arc Masterclass labs

## Goals

In this immersive lab, participants will embark on a hands-on journey to explore the capabilities of Azure Arc & Azure Local. Utilizing the Azure Arc Jumpstart resources, attendees will gain a deep understanding of how Azure Arc functions and its applications in a real-world scenario. The workshop is crafted to encourage active participation, enabling attendees to not only listen but also engage directly with the material through hands-on labs.
